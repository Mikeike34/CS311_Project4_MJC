<!-- 
 Composer page grid is not following the pdf example. 

 The issue was that I could not get the rows and columns to line up exactly like the pdf file. What I did instead was eliminate some rows and columns. 
 The composer pages now only use a column for the list of songs, a column for the information about the composer, and then a column for the author of the page at the bottom. 
 The name for the composer, blurb about their life, and their picture is all a part of the same column rather than different columns like the pdf showed. 
 This allowed me to structure it closure to the idea in the pdf; however, this design now lacks the customizability that seperate columns would allow. 
 
 Each composer page follows the exact same structure and uses the same CSS file. This helps with creating a uniform look on each page and sped up development time. 

 At first I could not figure out how to link pages to the menu created. Some searching online helped me see how to link another HTML page to the menu. 

 importing bootstrap was simple and allowed for some use of the resources on bootstrap's website. I used the navbar for example. 

 The website seems to be working according to the instructions for the assignment. Each page represents the layout of the assingment to the best of my ability. 
 Though I eliminated some of the grid structure that the instructions seemed to show in the PDF, I feel I created webpages that look and behave according to the instructions.
